## Scaling Your VPC Network with AWS Transit Gateway
This section explores how to connect multiple Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) using AWS Transit Gateway, a centralized, scalable solution for network connectivity. Below, we detail the key concepts, configurations, and scenarios for effective VPC scaling and connectivity.

- **Network Design with Multiple VPCs**:
  - Expanding business or architecture may require multiple VPCs for security, architectural, or management purposes.
  - **Full Mesh Architecture**: Every VPC connects directly to every other VPC, ideal for small networks needing fast speeds and low latency. For N VPCs, connections = N * (N–1) / 2 (e.g., 4 VPCs need 6 connections, 100 VPCs need 4,950 connections), creating high operational overhead.
  - **Hub-and-Spoke Architecture**: A central hub manages connectivity, requiring only one connection per VPC (e.g., 4 VPCs need 4 connections, 100 VPCs need 100 connections), simplifying management and suitable for large networks with tolerable hub latency.

- **AWS Transit Gateway**:
  - A managed AWS service acting as a centralized, Regional router for connecting VPCs and on-premises networks using a hub-and-spoke architecture.
  - Automatically scales based on network traffic volume, supporting thousands of VPCs and on-premises networks.
  - Supports dynamic and static routing, IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, and peering with other transit gateways in different AWS Regions or accounts.
  - Traffic stays on the AWS global backbone, reducing threats like exploits and DDoS attacks.
  - Incurs costs based on the number of connections and traffic throughput.
  - **Transit Gateway Flow Logs**: Captures IP traffic information, published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.

- **Centralized VPC Routing Pattern**:
  - Scenario: Connect multiple VPCs for full resource access within a single Region, using non-overlapping IP address spaces.
  - Steps:
    - Create a VPC attachment to connect the transit gateway to each VPC via an elastic network interface in at least one subnet per Availability Zone.
    - Add a transit gateway route to each VPC route table (e.g., destination 10.0.0.0/8, target: transit gateway ID) to route traffic to other VPCs via the transit gateway.
    - Configure the transit gateway route table to route traffic to VPC attachments (e.g., destination 10.1.0.0/16, target: VPC 1 attachment ID).
  - Example: VPC 1 route table routes 10.0.0.0/8 to transit gateway ID; transit gateway routes 10.1.0.0/16 to VPC 1 attachment and 10.2.0.0/16 to VPC 2 attachment.

- **Centralized Routing Pattern for Outbound Traffic**:
  - Use a dedicated egress VPC with a NAT gateway to centralize outbound internet traffic for security and monitoring.
  - Example: VPC 1 routes outbound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the transit gateway, which forwards to the egress VPC’s NAT gateway in a public subnet, then to an internet gateway.
  - Benefits: Simplifies NAT gateway management, reduces costs, and centralizes access to shared services (e.g., traffic inspection, interface VPC endpoints).
  - For redundancy, deploy a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone in the egress VPC.

- **Transit Gateway Peering**:
  - Enables traffic flow between transit gateways in different AWS Regions or accounts.
  - Create a peering attachment on one transit gateway, specifying a target transit gateway; the accepter transit gateway must accept the request.
  - Add static routes to the transit gateway route tables (e.g., transit gateway A routes 11.1.0.0/16 to peering attachment, transit gateway B routes 10.1.0.0/16 and 10.2.0.0/16 to peering attachment).
  - Traffic remains secure on the AWS backbone, not traversing the public internet.
  - Example: VPC 1 and VPC 2 in transit gateway A connect to VPC 3 in transit gateway B via peering.

- **Company Group of Departments Use Case**:
  - Scenario: A company with multiple IT departments, each with a VPC in the same or different AWS accounts, needs full resource access across VPCs with potential for future account additions.
  - Solution: Connect each VPC to a transit gateway for minimal maintenance and scalability, using the hub-and-spoke model.
  - Alternative: For limited access (e.g., one VPC to another), update route tables to target specific IP ranges.

- **Activity: Configure AWS Transit Gateway Routes**:
  - Configure routes for five VPCs (vpc-a to vpc-e) to connect via transit gateway tgw-1.
  - **VPC Route Tables**: Add destination 10.0.0.0/8 and target tgw-1 to each VPC route table (rtb-vpc-a to rtb-vpc-e) for full connectivity.
  - **Transit Gateway Route Table**: Add destinations (10.1.0.0/16 to 10.5.0.0/16) with corresponding targets (tgw-attach-vpc-a to tgw-attach-vpc-e).

- **Solution: VPC Route Tables**:
  - For each VPC (vpc-a to vpc-e, CIDRs 10.1.0.0/16 to 10.5.0.0/16), route table entries: destination 10.0.0.0/8, target tgw-1, ensuring traffic to other VPCs routes via the transit gateway.
  - Using 10.0.0.0/8 limits routing to VPC CIDR ranges, avoiding broader 0.0.0.0/0 routing.

- **Solution: Transit Gateway tgw-1 Route Table**:
  - Destinations: 10.1.0.0/16 to 10.5.0.0/16.
  - Targets: tgw-attach-vpc-a to tgw-attach-vpc-e, directing traffic to the respective VPC attachments.

- **Key Takeaways: Scaling Your VPC Network with Transit Gateway**:
  - Transit Gateway is a centralized Regional router to connect VPCs.
  - Transit Gateway can be peered with other transit gateways in other AWS Regions and AWS accounts.
  - Transit Gateway supports thousands of attachments.
  - Transit Gateway charges per hour for the number of connections and the amount of traffic that flows through the transit gateway.

# Connecting VPCs in AWS with VPC Peering: Connecting Networks
This section explores how to connect Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) using VPC peering, a cost-effective method for establishing one-to-one network connections. Below, we detail the key concepts, configurations, limitations, and use cases for VPC peering, including its integration with AWS PrivateLink.

- **Mesh Architecture Using VPC Peering**:
  - Use VPC peering for small numbers of VPCs or when budgets limit use of AWS Transit Gateway; no cost for creating VPC peering connections.
  - Enables Amazon EC2 instances in two VPCs to communicate using private IP addresses, as if in the same network.
  - Supports peering within the same AWS account, different accounts, or across AWS Regions for resource sharing or geographic redundancy.
  - Traffic stays on the AWS global backbone, avoiding the public internet, reducing threats like exploits and DDoS attacks.
  - Inter-Region traffic is encrypted, with no single point of failure or bandwidth bottlenecks.
  - Data transfer across Availability Zones or Regions incurs standard data transfer rates.

- **Establishing VPC Peering**:
  - Process: VPC A owner sends a peering request to VPC B owner; VPC B owner must accept to activate the connection.
  - CIDR blocks of peered VPCs must not overlap.
  - Configure route tables: 
    - VPC A route table adds destination 10.2.0.0/16 (VPC B CIDR) with target as the VPC A-B peering connection ID.
    - VPC B route table adds destination 10.1.0.0/16 (VPC A CIDR) with target as the VPC A-B peering connection ID.
  - Update security group rules to allow traffic to and from the peered VPC.
  - Example: Two startups collaborating can peer VPCs for secure, private resource sharing over the AWS network.

- **VPC Peering Does Not Support Transitive Peering**:
  - Peering is one-to-one; transitive peering is not supported (e.g., VPC A peered with VPC B, and VPC B peered with VPC C, does not connect VPC A to VPC C).
  - Enhances security and manageability by isolating errors and limiting the blast radius of network attacks.
  - Limitations:
    - Peering not possible with overlapping CIDR blocks.
    - No access to internet or NAT gateways in the peered VPC.
    - Only VPC owners can manage their peering connections.

- **VPC Peering Configurations with Specific Routes**:
  - Configure route tables to restrict access to specific subnet CIDR blocks, multiple CIDR blocks, or individual resource IP addresses.
  - Example: VPC A route table routes to a specific EC2 instance in VPC B (10.2.1.18/32) via the peering connection; VPC B routes to a subnet in VPC A (10.1.1.0/20).

- **Use Cases: Peering to One VPC to Access Centralized Resources**:
  - **File Sharing VPC**: Peer multiple VPCs to a central file-sharing VPC without allowing traffic between other VPCs.
  - **Customer Shared VPC**: Customers peer their VPCs to a company’s shared VPC, with no visibility or routing to other customer VPCs.
  - **Active Directory VPC**: Peer VPCs to a central Active Directory VPC for specific instance access, with response traffic routed back to those instances.

- **VPC Connectivity with AWS PrivateLink Architecture**:
  - Use AWS PrivateLink to connect VPCs at the application level or with overlapping CIDR blocks, without a peering connection.
  - Example: A consumer VPC creates an elastic network interface endpoint to a Network Load Balancer in a service provider VPC, allowing connectivity despite overlapping CIDRs (e.g., 10.1.0.0/16).
  - Consumer VPCs initiate connections to the service provider VPC, enhancing security.

- **Key Takeaways: Connecting VPCs in AWS with VPC Peering**:
  - VPC peering establishes a one-to-one networking connection between two VPCs to provide private network traffic routes.
  - VPC peering does not incur costs, but transferring data across Availability Zones and Regions does.
  - VPC peering can provide network traffic flow between different AWS accounts and AWS Regions.
  - VPC peering does not support transitive VPC peering relationships.
  - If VPC CIDR blocks overlap, use PrivateLink with a Network Load Balancer to establish VPC connectivity.

# Connecting to Your Remote Network with AWS Site-to-Site VPN: Connecting Networks
This section explores how to connect an on-premises network to an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using AWS Site-to-Site VPN, including configurations for high availability, acceleration, and isolation. Below, we detail the key concepts, steps, and scenarios for secure and efficient connectivity.

- **Connecting On-Premises Environments to a VPC**:
  - By default, VPC instances cannot communicate with on-premises networks, requiring a secure connection mechanism like AWS Site-to-Site VPN.

- **AWS Site-to-Site VPN**:
  - Creates a secure connection between an on-premises customer gateway and an AWS virtual private gateway (or transit gateway) for VPC access.
  - Uses two encrypted IPsec VPN tunnels across multiple Availability Zones for high availability; primary traffic uses one tunnel, with the second for redundancy.
  - Operates over the public internet but encrypts traffic to ensure security.
  - Charges apply per VPN connection-hour when provisioned and available.
  - Can be set up quickly, typically within hours.

- **Creating a Site-to-Site VPN Connection**:
  - Steps:
    1. Create a VPC customer gateway (physical or software device in the on-premises network) with a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN) if supported.
    2. Create a virtual private gateway with a unique private BGP ASN (or use the Amazon default ASN) or use a transit gateway instead.
    3. Configure VPC route tables to include routes pointing to the virtual private gateway; enable route propagation for automatic Site-to-Site VPN route updates.
    4. Update security groups to allow protocols like SSH, RDP, or ICMP from the on-premises network.
    5. Create the Site-to-Site VPN connection, specifying the customer gateway, virtual private gateway, and two tunnels across Availability Zones.
    6. Download the configuration file to configure the customer gateway device.
  - Supports dynamic routing (BGP for route advertisement) or static routing (manually specify IP prefixes); BGP is recommended for robust health checks and failover.
  - VPN relies on internet connectivity, which is not guaranteed.

- **Connecting Multiple On-Premises Networks by Using AWS VPN CloudHub**:
  - AWS VPN CloudHub uses a hub-and-spoke model to connect multiple on-premises networks to each other and optionally to a VPC.
  - Uses a virtual private gateway with multiple customer gateways, each with unique BGP ASNs.
  - Customer gateways advertise routes via BGP, which are re-advertised to other BGP peers for connectivity.
  - Requires non-overlapping IP ranges for remote sites.
  - Example: VPN connection 1 carries traffic from on-premises network 1 to networks 2 and 3, and vice versa.

- **Accelerating Site-to-Site VPN Connections**:
  - AWS Global Accelerator routes traffic from the on-premises network to the nearest AWS edge location, then over the AWS backbone to a transit gateway (not a virtual private gateway), improving response times.
  - Reduces disruptions from public internet traffic.
  - Example: On-premises network connects to Global Accelerator, then to a transit gateway, and finally to a VPC via a transit gateway VPC attachment.

- **Isolating VPCs with Full VPN Access by Using Transit Gateway**:
  - Scenario: On-premises network needs full access to VPCs, but VPCs must be isolated from each other.
  - Solution: Use multiple transit gateway route tables to create isolated routing domains.
  - Configuration:
    - On-premises route table routes all traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the transit gateway.
    - Transit gateway VPN route table routes to VPCs (e.g., 10.1.0.0/16 to VPC 1, 10.2.0.0/16 to VPC 2).
    - Transit gateway VPC route table routes to the on-premises network (e.g., 10.99.99.0/24 to VPN attachment) but not between VPCs.
  - Example: Traffic from VPC 1 to VPC 2 (10.2.0.0/16) is blocked due to no route in the VPC route table, ensuring isolation.

- **Key Takeaways: Connecting to Your Remote Network with Site-to-Site VPN**:
  - Site-to-Site VPN creates a secure connection between an on-premises customer gateway and an AWS virtual private gateway (or transit gateway) for VPC access.
  - You can connect multiple on-premises networks to a single virtual private gateway.
  - Use Global Accelerator to accelerate Site-to-Site VPN connections.
  - Configure multiple Transit Gateway routing tables to isolate VPCs to provide full VPN access.

# Connecting to Your Remote Network with AWS Direct Connect: Connecting Networks
This section explores how to connect an on-premises network to an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using AWS Direct Connect, a dedicated, private network connection for enhanced performance and security. Below, we detail the key concepts, use cases, configurations, and strategies for high availability and resiliency.

- **AWS Direct Connect**:
  - Establishes a dedicated, private virtual local area network (VLAN) connection from an on-premises network to AWS resources, extending the on-premises network.
  - Offers consistent network performance, increased bandwidth, and higher throughput compared to internet-based connections like Site-to-Site VPN.
  - Uses industry-standard 802.1Q VLANs and connects via Direct Connect locations associated with an AWS Region, allowing access to any VPC or public AWS service (except China).

- **Direct Connect Use Cases**:
  - **Hybrid Environments**: Enables applications to access on-premises data center equipment (e.g., databases) while leveraging AWS elasticity and cost benefits.
  - **Large Datasets**: Ideal for high-performance computing (HPC) or large data transfers, reducing transfer time, network congestion, and costs compared to internet-based transfers.
    - Benefits: Avoids competing for internet bandwidth, reduces ISP fees, and uses lower Direct Connect data transfer rates.
  - **Predictable Network Performance**: Supports applications requiring consistent performance (e.g., real-time audio/video streams).
  - **Security and Compliance**: Meets enterprise security or regulatory requirements by routing traffic over a private network, avoiding the public internet.

- **Extend an On-Premises Network to AWS by Using Direct Connect**:
  - **Connection Types**:
    - **Dedicated Connection**: A physical Ethernet fiber-optic cable for exclusive customer use, connecting the on-premises router to a Direct Connect location router.
    - **Hosted Connection**: A shared Ethernet fiber-optic cable provisioned by a Direct Connect Partner, offering more bandwidth options in smaller increments.
  - **Virtual Interfaces**:
    - **Public Virtual Interface**: Connects to public AWS services (e.g., Amazon S3).
    - **Private Virtual Interface**: Connects to a VPC via a virtual private gateway.
    - **Transit Virtual Interface**: Connects to a VPC via a transit gateway.
  - Example: VLAN 1 uses a private virtual interface to connect a Direct Connect endpoint to a VPC virtual private gateway; VLAN 2 uses a public virtual interface to connect to Amazon S3.
  - Implementation requires planning and physical resources, typically spanning multiple weeks.

- **Direct Connect Using Transit Gateway**:
  - Simplifies routing by connecting a Direct Connect location to a transit gateway via a Direct Connect gateway and a transit virtual interface.
  - Example: VLAN 3 connects an on-premises router to a Direct Connect endpoint, then to a Direct Connect gateway, transit gateway, and VPC via a transit gateway VPC attachment.

- **High Availability Direct Connect and Backup VPN Use Case**:
  - Combine Direct Connect (primary) with a Site-to-Site VPN (backup) for high availability.
  - Configuration: Use two dynamically routed connections (one Direct Connect, one VPN) from different customer devices; AWS prefers Direct Connect traffic by default.
  - Requires internal-route propagation configuration to ensure proper path selection.
  - Options: Use multiple Direct Connect circuits, VPN tunnels, or locations across separate IP spaces or Regions; consider AWS Marketplace appliances to manage VPN shutdowns.
  - Example: Primary Direct Connect and backup VPN ensure continuous connectivity, with provider selection based on risk tolerance and cost.

- **High Resiliency with Multiple Direct Connect Locations**:
  - For critical workloads, use multiple Direct Connect locations to ensure resilience against hardware or location failures.
  - Example: On-premises network 1 connects to a virtual private gateway via Direct Connect location 1; if it fails, on-premises network 2 connects via Direct Connect location 2.
  - Best Practices:
    - Connect from multiple data centers for physical redundancy.
    - Use redundant hardware and telecommunications providers.
    - Implement dynamically routed, active/active connections for load balancing and failover.
    - Provision sufficient capacity to prevent degradation during failures.

- **Key Takeaways: Connecting to Your Remote Network with Direct Connect**:
  - Direct Connect is a dedicated, private, VLAN connection that extends an on-premises network to include AWS resources.
  - Use a private virtual interface to connect a Direct Connect location to a virtual private gateway.
  - Use a public virtual interface to connect a Direct Connect location to supported AWS services.
  - Use a transit virtual interface to connect a Direct Connect location to a transit gateway through a Direct Connect gateway.
  - Make your network highly available by using Direct Connect as a primary connection and a VPN as a backup connection.
  - Make your network highly resilient by connecting from multiple on-premises networks to AWS by using multiple Direct Connect locations.

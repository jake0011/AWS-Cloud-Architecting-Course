# Decoupling Your Architecture: Building Decoupled Architectures
This section introduces the concept of **decoupling** in system architecture, explaining the differences between tightly and loosely coupled systems, the challenges of tight coupling, and techniques for achieving loose coupling using AWS services like **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**, **Amazon SQS**, **Amazon SNS**, and **Amazon MQ**. It emphasizes the benefits of decoupling for scalability, resiliency, and maintainability, using the fictional café scenario as a context.

- **Tight Coupling in a Three-Tier Architecture**:
  - **Definition**: A system where components are highly dependent, such that changes or failures in one component directly impact others.
  - **Example**: A three-tier architecture (presentation, business logic, database) using **Amazon EC2** for web and application servers and **Amazon RDS** for the database.
    - **Communication**: Synchronous (send request, wait for reply).
    - **Example Flow**: Web server communicates directly with the application server, which interacts with the database.
  - **Challenges**:
    - **System Failure**: If the application server fails, the entire system fails, returning errors to clients.
    - **Maintenance Downtime**: Updating the application server (e.g., for bug fixes) requires taking the entire system offline.
    - **Scaling Complexity**: Adding new servers requires updating code to include new IP addresses and routing logic.
  - **Impact**: Tight coupling limits resiliency and scalability, making systems prone to bottlenecks and single points of failure.

- **Tight Coupling Increases the Complexity of Scaling**:
  - **Scenario**: Scaling a tightly coupled system by adding web servers and application servers (e.g., two additional web servers and one application server, with **Amazon Route 53** for DNS).
  - **Challenges**:
    - **Increased Connections**: Each new web server requires multiple connections (e.g., one to Route 53 and one to each application server), increasing complexity.
    - **Manual Outage Handling**: An application server outage impacts all connected web servers, requiring manual intervention.
    - **Example**: Adding one web server requires three new connections (to Route 53 and two application servers); adding an application server requires connections from all web servers.
  - **Impact**: Tight coupling complicates scaling and reduces system reliability.

- **Loose Coupling Between Tiers**:
  - **Solution**: Introduce an intermediary component to reduce direct dependencies, improving scalability and resiliency.
  - **Implementation in Three-Tier Architecture**:
    1. Add an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** (a type of ELB) in front of web servers:
       - Distributes traffic from **Route 53** to healthy web server instances.
       - Monitors instance health and routes traffic only to healthy instances.
    2. Add an ALB between web servers and application servers:
       - Manages workload distribution and failover routing between tiers.
    - **Scaling Benefit**: Adding a new web server requires only **two connections** (to ALB1 and ALB2), reducing complexity compared to tight coupling.
  - **Benefits**:
    - **Automatic Failover**: ALBs handle failures by rerouting traffic to healthy instances.
    - **Simplified Scaling**: New instances integrate seamlessly without code changes.
  - **Resources**: See the “Elastic Load Balancing User Guide” for details on ELB (linked in course resources).

- **Tight Coupling Within an Application**:
  - **Scenario**: A monolithic application with tightly coupled functions (e.g., finance transactions, image transcoding, calculations) deployed as a single unit on an application server.
  - **Challenges**:
    - **Single Point of Failure**: A slowdown or failure in one function (e.g., image transcoding) impacts the entire application, causing delays or unresponsiveness.
    - **Maintenance Downtime**: Changes to one function require redeploying the entire application, increasing downtime risk.
  - **Solution**: Use **microservice architecture** and **asynchronous messaging** to decouple functions.

- **Loose Coupling: Microservice Architecture**:
  - **Definition**: Divides application functions into independent **microservices**, each running in its own process with its own data and API.
  - **Example**:
    - Split a monolithic application into separate microservices for finance, transcoding, and calculations.
    - Each microservice runs in its own container, scales independently, and communicates via APIs.
    - Example: Finance microservice scales to three containers, while calculations uses one, based on demand.
  - **Benefits**:
    - **Independent Scaling**: Each microservice scales based on its workload.
    - **Isolated Failures**: A failure in one microservice (e.g., transcoding) does not affect others.
    - **Flexible Updates**: Modify one microservice without impacting others, minimizing downtime.
  - **Communication**: Microservices use **synchronous** (e.g., API calls) or **asynchronous** (e.g., messaging) communication.
  - **Resources**: See “Implementing Microservices on AWS” for details (linked in course resources).

- **Request Offloading: Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS**:
  - **Purpose**: Improve resiliency by making component interactions **asynchronous**, suitable for tasks not requiring immediate responses.
  - **Model**: Involves a **producer** (generates events) and a **consumer** (processes events) interacting via an intermediary like a queue or topic.
  - **Example Scenario**: A transcoding microservice in the web application has poor response times due to synchronous processing (one image at a time, delaying user responses).
  - **Solution with Asynchronous Messaging**:
    1. **Redesign with SQS**:
       - The transcoding microservice becomes a **message producer**, storing images in **Amazon S3** and sending messages to an **SQS queue**.
       - A separate **transcoding consumer application** polls the SQS queue, processes images, and scales independently.
       - The microservice responds immediately to users, acknowledging requests and allowing new submissions.
    2. **Notification with SNS**:
       - After transcoding, the consumer application sends a message to an **SNS topic**, which notifies users (e.g., via email) of completion.
  - **Benefits**:
    - **Improved Performance**: Asynchronous processing reduces user wait times.
    - **Scalability**: Consumer applications scale independently to handle varying workloads.
    - **Resiliency**: Failures in the consumer do not impact the producer or user experience.
  - **Use Case**: Suitable for tasks like image processing, where immediate responses are not required.

- **Loose Coupling: Amazon MQ**:
  - **Purpose**: Enables loose coupling between **on-premises applications** and AWS-based applications via asynchronous messaging.
  - **Scenario**: An on-premises application needs to use the AWS-based transcoding consumer application without direct, tightly coupled connections.
  - **Solution**:
    - Use an **Amazon MQ broker** to facilitate messaging between the on-premises application (producer) and the AWS consumer application.
    - The broker stores messages using **Amazon EFS** or **Amazon EBS**.
  - **Benefits**:
    - Provides a **message-based interface** for flexible, consistent integration.
    - Enables reuse of AWS functions by external clients without tight coupling.
  - **Use Case**: Hybrid architectures where on-premises systems interact with cloud-based services.

- **Categories of Solutions for Loose Coupling**:
  - **Synchronous Solutions**:
    - **Infrastructure Level**: Use **ELB** (e.g., ALB) to decouple tiers by distributing traffic and handling failover.
    - **Application Level**: Implement **microservice architecture** to separate functions into independent, reusable components.
  - **Asynchronous Solutions**:
    - **Queue-Based**: **Amazon SQS** enables asynchronous messaging via queues for tasks like request offloading.
    - **Topic-Based**: **Amazon SNS** and **Amazon MQ** use topics for publish/subscribe messaging, notifying multiple subscribers.
  - **Benefits of Loose Coupling**:
    - **Scalability**: Components scale independently without code changes.
    - **Resiliency**: Isolates failures, preventing system-wide impact.
    - **Agility**: Allows updates to individual components with minimal risk to others.

- **Key Takeaways: Decoupling Your Architecture**:
  - **Tightly coupled systems** are prone to bottlenecks, single points of failure, and scaling complexity.
  - **Loosely coupled architectures** remove direct dependencies, improving scalability and resiliency.
  - Loose coupling introduces **intermediary components** (e.g., ELB, SQS, SNS, MQ) to decouple infrastructure layers or application functions.
  - **Synchronous solutions**: Use ELB for infrastructure and microservices for application-level decoupling.
  - **Asynchronous solutions**: Use SQS for queue-based messaging, and SNS or MQ for topic-based messaging.

# Decoupling Applications with Amazon SQS: Building Decoupled Architectures
This section explores how **Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)** enables asynchronous decoupling of application components through **point-to-point messaging**. It covers the mechanics of SQS, its benefits, components, queue types, configuration options, and use cases, emphasizing how it enhances scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance in distributed systems.

- **Point-to-Point Messaging**:
  - **Definition**: An asynchronous messaging model where a **producer** (sending application) sends messages to a single **consumer** (receiving application) via a **message queue**.
  - **Purpose**: Decouples applications, allowing them to operate independently without direct, synchronous communication.
  - **Components**:
    - **Producer**: Generates messages and places them in the queue.
    - **Consumer**: Retrieves and processes messages from the queue using a **pull mechanism** (polling the queue periodically).
    - **Message**: Data (e.g., requests, replies, errors, or information like customer records, orders) sent from producer to consumer.
    - **Message Queue**: A temporary repository that stores messages until processed.
  - **Message Flow**:
    1. Producer sends a message to the queue.
    2. Queue stores the message redundantly across servers.
    3. Consumer polls the queue, retrieves the message, and processes it.
  - **Benefits**: Enables asynchronous communication, reducing dependencies and improving system resilience.

- **Amazon SQS Overview**:
  - **Definition**: A fully managed message queuing service that decouples distributed software systems and application components.
  - **Key Features**:
    - **Highly Available**: Stores queues and messages in a single AWS Region with multiple redundant Availability Zones to prevent failures.
    - **Scalable**: Processes billions of messages per day, scaling elastically with usage.
    - **Secure**: Supports encryption with **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** for sensitive data.
    - **Accessible**: Offers an **AWS Management Console** interface and a **web services API** via AWS SDKs.
  - **Purpose**: Acts as a buffer between producers and consumers, allowing independent operation and failure isolation.

- **Amazon SQS Benefits**:
  - **Fully Managed**: Eliminates the need to manage messaging software or infrastructure, with automatic provisioning of compute, storage, and networking resources.
  - **Reliability**: Ensures high message durability by storing messages on multiple servers, delivering large volumes of data without loss.
  - **Security**: Supports **server-side encryption (SSE)** with AWS KMS to secure sensitive data; allows control over who can send/receive messages.
  - **Scalability**: Scales elastically based on usage, supporting multiple producers and consumers simultaneously without capacity planning.
  - **Cost-Effectiveness**: No pre-provisioning required; scales up/down dynamically to manage costs.

- **Amazon SQS Basic Components**:
  - **Message**:
    - Size: Up to **256 KB** (XML, JSON, or unformatted text).
    - Large messages (up to 2 GB) supported via the **Amazon SQS Extended Client Library for Java**.
    - Retention: Stored until explicitly deleted or the queue’s **message retention period** expires (default: 4 days, configurable up to 14 days).
  - **Queue**:
    - Types: **Standard** and **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)**.
    - Configurable Parameters:
      - **Message Retention Period**: Time messages are retained (4 days default, up to 14 days).
      - **Visibility Timeout**: Time a message is invisible to other consumers after being retrieved (default: 30 seconds, max: 12 hours).
      - **Receive Message Wait Time**: Controls polling behavior (short polling: 0 seconds; long polling: up to 20 seconds).
  - **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)**:
    - A queue that stores messages that cannot be processed successfully after exceeding the maximum processing attempts.
    - Must match the source queue type (standard DLQ for standard queues, FIFO DLQ for FIFO queues).
    - Allows retry or later reprocessing of failed messages.

- **Decoupling Example: Amazon SQS**:
  - **Scenario**: A web application with **order capture** and **order fulfillment** functions, initially tightly coupled in a monolithic design.
  - **Solution**:
    - Introduce an **SQS queue** (customer order queue) to decouple the functions.
    - **Order Capture (Producer)**:
      - Runs on three EC2 instances behind an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.
      - Sends customer orders as messages to the SQS queue.
    - **Order Fulfillment (Consumer)**:
      - Runs on two EC2 instances, polling the queue to retrieve and process orders.
      - Deletes messages from the queue after successful processing.
      - Sends unprocessed messages to a **DLQ** for later reprocessing.
  - **Benefits**:
    - **Resilience to Traffic Spikes**: The queue buffers spikes, allowing independent scaling of order capture and fulfillment.
    - **Asynchronous Processing**: Orders are processed at a controlled pace, optimizing costs.
    - **Fault Tolerance**: Failed messages are retried or moved to the DLQ, preventing data loss.

- **Queue Types**:
  - **Standard Queue**:
    - **Features**:
      - **At-Least-Once Delivery**: Messages are delivered at least once, but duplicates may occur.
      - **Best-Effort Ordering**: Messages may be delivered out of order.
      - **Nearly Unlimited Throughput**: Supports high API call rates per second.
    - **Use Case**: Applications where occasional duplicates or out-of-order messages are acceptable (e.g., logging, analytics).
  - **FIFO Queue**:
    - **Features**:
      - **First-In-First-Out Delivery**: Preserves exact message order.
      - **Exactly-Once Processing**: Ensures each message is processed only once.
      - **High Throughput**: Up to 300 API calls per second (or 3,000 with batching of 10 messages).
    - **Use Case**: Applications requiring strict order and no duplicates (e.g., financial transactions, order processing).
  - **Example**:
    - Standard Queue: Messages enter as 1, 2, 3 but may exit as 3, 1, 3, 2 with duplicates.
    - FIFO Queue: Messages enter and exit as 1, 2, 3 with no duplicates.

- **Queue Configuration: Polling Type**:
  - **Receive Message Wait Time**: Controls whether the queue uses **short polling** (default, 0 seconds) or **long polling** (up to 20 seconds).
  - **Short Polling**:
    - Queries a subset of servers, returning immediately even if no messages are found.
    - Faster response but increases costs due to frequent empty responses.
    - Suitable for real-time applications (e.g., stock price updates) or single-threaded apps polling multiple queues.
  - **Long Polling**:
    - Queries all servers, waiting until a message is available or the wait time expires.
    - Reduces empty responses, lowering costs and improving efficiency.
    - Recommended for most use cases, except when immediate responses are critical.
  - **Consideration**: Long polling is generally preferred unless the application requires immediate responses or polls multiple queues with a single thread.

- **Queue Configuration: Message Visibility**:
  - **Visibility Timeout**:
    - Prevents other consumers from processing the same message during a set period (default: 30 seconds, max: 12 hours).
    - Ensures no duplicate processing; consumer must delete the message within this period.
    - Set to the maximum time required to process and delete a message (e.g., 15 seconds if processing takes up to 15 seconds).
  - **Example Flow**:
    1. Consumer 1 requests a message; the queue returns message 1 and starts the visibility timeout.
    2. Message 1 becomes invisible to other consumers (e.g., Consumer 2) during the timeout.
    3. If Consumer 1 fails to delete the message before the timeout expires, it becomes visible again for reprocessing.

- **How SQS Message Queueing Works**:
  - **Lifecycle**:
    1. Producer sends a message to the queue; it is stored redundantly across servers.
    2. Consumer retrieves the message, triggering the **visibility timeout** (e.g., 40 seconds); the message remains in the queue but is invisible to others.
    3. Consumer processes and deletes the message within the timeout to prevent reprocessing.
  - **Failure Handling**:
    - If the consumer fails to delete the message (e.g., due to connectivity issues), it becomes visible again after the timeout.
    - Failed messages exceeding maximum processing attempts are moved to the **DLQ**.
  - **Note**: SQS does not automatically delete messages; consumers must explicitly delete them after processing.

- **Amazon SQS Use Cases**:
  - **Work Queues**:
    - Decouple components with different processing rates (e.g., a car navigation system collecting real-time sensor data and updating a map database via an SQS queue).
    - Consumers in an **Auto Scaling group** process queued work, scaling based on workload.
  - **Buffering and Batch Operations**:
    - Buffer traffic spikes or batch tasks for later processing (e.g., a stock trading app batching transactions during the day for overnight portfolio updates).
    - Enhances scalability and reliability without losing messages.
  - **Request Offloading**:
    - Move slow operations off interactive paths (e.g., a banking app queuing bill payments for backend processing, providing immediate user responses).
  - **Trigger Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling**:
    - Use queue metrics (e.g., **NumberOfMessagesSent**) with **Amazon CloudWatch** alarms to trigger scaling actions.
    - Example: Scale out EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group if the queue has more than 10 pending orders.
  - **Non-Recommended Scenarios**:
    - **Selecting Specific Messages**: SQS does not support selective message retrieval based on attributes; unconsumed messages may persist.
    - **Large Messages**: For messages over 256 KB, use **Amazon S3** to store data and pass references in SQS messages.

- **Key Takeaways: Decoupling Applications with Amazon SQS**:
  - Amazon SQS is a **fully managed message queuing service** that decouples application components for independent operation.
  - Supports **standard queues** (at-least-once delivery, best-effort ordering) and **FIFO queues** (exact order, exactly-once processing).
  - **Dead-letter queues** handle failed messages for retry or later reprocessing.
  - **Long polling** reduces costs by minimizing empty responses compared to short polling.
  - Producers send messages to queues; consumers process and delete them during the **visibility timeout** to prevent duplication.

# Decoupling Applications with Amazon SNS: Building Decoupled Architectures
This section explores how **Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)** enables asynchronous decoupling of applications using a **publish/subscribe (pub/sub)** messaging model. It covers the mechanics of SNS, its benefits, use cases, considerations, and how it integrates with **Amazon SQS** for fanout scenarios, emphasizing its role in creating scalable and resilient architectures.

- **Publish/Subscribe Messaging**:
  - **Definition**: An asynchronous messaging model where a **publisher** sends messages to multiple **subscribers** via a **topic**, without needing to know the subscribers' details.
  - **Components**:
    - **Publisher**: Sends messages to a topic.
    - **Subscriber**: Receives messages by subscribing to the topic.
    - **Topic**: An interim destination that broadcasts messages to all subscribers using a **push mechanism**.
  - **Message Flow**:
    1. Subscribers register interest by subscribing to a topic.
    2. The publisher sends a message to the topic.
    3. The topic pushes the message to all subscribers simultaneously.
  - **Characteristics**:
    - **Push Mechanism**: Messages are delivered instantly to subscribers, eliminating the need for polling.
    - **One-to-Many**: A single message can be broadcast to multiple subscribers, each performing different functions in parallel.
    - **Decoupling**: Publishers and subscribers operate independently, unaware of each other’s identity.
  - **Contrast with SQS**: Unlike SQS queues (point-to-point, pull-based, persistent messages), SNS topics are push-based, non-persistent, and support one-to-many communication.

- **Amazon SNS Overview**:
  - **Definition**: A fully managed pub/sub messaging service for sending notifications from the cloud.
  - **Key Features**:
    - **Highly Scalable**: Supports unlimited message publishing, handling large-scale applications.
    - **Secure**: Uses **TLS** for secure message transmission; supports access control policies.
    - **Cost-Effective**: Pay-as-you-go pricing with no maintenance overhead.
    - **Accessible**: Offers an **AWS Management Console** and **web services API** via AWS SDKs.
  - **Operation**:
    - Create a **topic** with a unique name (SNS endpoint) and set policies to control who can publish or subscribe.
    - Publishers send messages to the topic; SNS delivers them to all subscribed endpoints (e.g., SQS queues, HTTP endpoints, email, SMS).
    - Messages are stored redundantly across multiple Availability Zones until delivered, then deleted (non-persistent).

- **Amazon SNS Benefits**:
  - **Fully Managed**: No need to manage messaging infrastructure; SNS handles provisioning and scaling.
  - **Reliability**: Stores messages across multiple Availability Zones for durability before delivery.
  - **Scalability**: Supports unlimited messages and subscribers, scaling seamlessly with demand.
  - **Security**: Encrypts message channels with TLS and allows fine-grained access control.
  - **Flexibility**: Supports multiple delivery protocols (e.g., HTTP, email, SMS, SQS, Lambda).

- **Amazon SNS Use Cases**:
  - **Application and System Alerts**:
    - Send immediate notifications for events (e.g., changes in an **Auto Scaling group**).
    - Example: Notify administrators of system health issues via email or SMS.
  - **Push Email and Text Messaging**:
    - Deliver targeted news or updates to subscribers (e.g., news headlines via email or SMS).
  - **Mobile Push Notifications**:
    - Send notifications to mobile apps (e.g., update availability with a download link).
  - **Event-Driven Workflows**:
    - Trigger actions across multiple services (e.g., notifying multiple systems of a new file upload).

- **Decoupling Example: Using Amazon SQS with Amazon SNS (Fanout Scenario)**:
  - **Scenario**: A mobile client uploads an image to an **S3 bucket** for resizing into three formats (thumbnail, mobile, web).
  - **Architecture**:
    1. The mobile app uploads the image to an S3 bucket.
    2. S3’s **event notification** feature publishes a message (with the image’s object URL) to an **SNS topic**.
    3. The SNS topic **fans out** the message to three **SQS queues**: generate thumbnail, size for mobile, and size for web.
    4. Each queue is polled by a separate application in an **Auto Scaling group**:
       - Thumbnail app processes the generate thumbnail queue.
       - Mobile sizing app processes the size for mobile queue.
       - Web sizing app processes the size for web queue.
    5. Each application resizes the image independently and stores the result in a **converted images S3 bucket**.
  - **Benefits**:
    - **Parallel Processing**: Multiple applications process the same message concurrently.
    - **Scalability**: Each application scales independently based on queue load.
    - **Decoupling**: The mobile app, SNS topic, and SQS queues operate independently, enhancing resilience.
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios requiring multiple consumers to process the same event differently (e.g., image processing, log analysis).

- **Amazon SNS Considerations**:
  - **Message Publishing**:
    - Each notification contains a **single published message**.
    - No recall option for successfully delivered messages.
  - **Message Delivery**:
    - **Standard Topic**: Attempts to deliver messages in order but may result in out-of-order delivery due to network issues.
    - **FIFO Topic**: Ensures strict message ordering and exactly-once delivery.
    - Choose standard topics for non-critical order scenarios; use FIFO for strict ordering needs (e.g., financial transactions).
  - **Delivery Policy**:
    - SNS defines retry policies for each delivery protocol (e.g., HTTP, email).
    - Customizable for **HTTP/HTTPS endpoints** to adjust retry behavior based on server capacity.
    - If retries fail, messages are discarded unless a **dead-letter queue (DLQ)** is attached to the subscription.
  - **Best Practice**: Use FIFO topics with SQS FIFO queues for ordered processing; attach DLQs for handling failed deliveries.

- **Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS Comparison**:
  - **Messaging Model**:
    - SNS: **Publisher-Subscriber** (one-to-many, publisher unaware of subscribers).
    - SQS: **Producer-Consumer** (one-to-one, producer targets a specific consumer).
  - **Distribution Model**:
    - SNS: One message to multiple subscribers.
    - SQS: One message to one consumer.
  - **Delivery Mechanism**:
    - SNS: **Push** (immediate delivery to subscribers).
    - SQS: **Pull** (consumer polls the queue).
  - **Message Persistence**:
    - SNS: Non-persistent; messages are deleted after delivery.
    - SQS: Persistent until deleted or retention period expires.
  - **Use Case Example**:
    - SNS: Notify multiple systems of an event (e.g., file upload notification to multiple apps).
    - SQS: Queue tasks for a single consumer (e.g., process orders sequentially).

- **Key Takeaways: Decoupling Applications with Amazon SNS**:
  - Amazon SNS is a **fully managed pub/sub messaging service** for sending notifications and decoupling applications.
  - Uses a **publisher-subscriber model** with topics to broadcast messages to multiple subscribers.
  - Requires creating a **topic**, defining **subscribers**, and publishing messages.
  - Supports **fanout** to multiple recipients (e.g., SQS queues, HTTP endpoints) for parallel processing.
  - Integrates with AWS services to trigger **event-driven workflows** and notifications.

      - **Use Case**: Integrating on-premises legacy systems with cloud applications or migrating existing message brokers.
  - **Recommendations**:
    - Use **Amazon MQ** for:
      - Integrating **on-premises and cloud applications** without rewriting messaging code.
      - Migrating **standards-based message brokers** (e.g., ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ) to AWS to reduce maintenance and licensing costs.
    - Use **Amazon SQS and SNS** for:
      - New **cloud-native applications** to leverage fully managed, API-driven queue and topic services.
  - **Key Considerations**:
    - Amazon MQ supports **open standard protocols**, making it ideal for legacy systems.
    - SQS and SNS offer simpler, cloud-optimized APIs but lack compatibility with traditional messaging protocols.

- **Key Takeaways: Decoupling a Hybrid Application with Amazon MQ**:
  - Amazon MQ is a **managed service** for running **Apache ActiveMQ** and **RabbitMQ** message brokers in the AWS Cloud.
  - Compatible with **open standard messaging APIs and protocols** (e.g., JMS, AMQP), enabling seamless integration.
  - Facilitates **hybrid environments** by connecting on-premises and cloud applications in a loosely coupled manner.
  - Supports **message broker migration** to AWS, reducing maintenance and improving stability.


### Module Wrap-Up:
  - **Module Summary**:
    - Differentiated **tightly coupled** (dependent, prone to failures) and **loosely coupled** (independent, scalable) architectures.
    - Explored **Amazon SQS** for point-to-point messaging, enabling asynchronous decoupling of producers and consumers.
    - Covered **Amazon SNS** for publish/subscribe messaging, supporting fanout to multiple subscribers.
    - Described **Amazon MQ** for hybrid environments and legacy broker migration.
    - Demonstrated decoupling workloads using **SQS** in a guided lab.
  - **Key Benefits of Decoupling**:
    - **Scalability**: Components scale independently without code changes.
    - **Resiliency**: Isolates failures, preventing system-wide impact.
    - **Maintainability**: Allows updates to individual components with minimal downtime.
  - **AWS Services**:
    - **SQS**: Fully managed queue service for one-to-one messaging, with standard and FIFO queues.
    - **SNS**: Fully managed pub/sub service for one-to-many notifications.
    - **MQ**: Managed broker for hybrid and legacy integrations using standard protocols.
    - **ELB**: Synchronous decoupling at the infrastructure level (e.g., ALB for load balancing).
